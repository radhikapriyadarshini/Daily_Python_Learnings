Day 1: Calculated power using Ohmâ€™s law, with a simple Python function.
Day 2: Extended to multiple resistances using lists and loops to compute total load power.
Day 3: Implemented series resistance calculation with functions and list operations.
Day 4: Built parallel resistance calculator using loops and reciprocal summation.
Day 5: Used dictionaries to model loads and compute apparent power and power factor.
Day 6: Designed a ThreePhaseLoad class with methods to compute 3-phase power.
Day 7: Leveraged NumPy arrays to calculate transmission losses and system efficiency.
Day 8: Managed bus impedance data in Pandas DataFrame to compute fault currents and export results to CSV.
