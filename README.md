1. **Day 1:** Kicked off with a spark ⚡ — calculated power using Ohm’s law in Python.
2. **Day 2:** Scaled it up 🔄 — looped through multiple loads and summed their total power.
3. **Day 3:** Wired resistors in series 🔗 — mastered list operations for equivalent resistance.
4. **Day 4:** Switched to parallel 🔀 — built a loop-based calculator for combined resistance.
5. **Day 5:** Added load personality 🗂️ — used dictionaries to compute S and Power Factor.
6. **Day 6:** Got object-oriented 🏗️ — created a `ThreePhaseLoad` class with real power brains.
7. **Day 7:** Boosted efficiency 💡 — used NumPy arrays to crunch transmission losses fast.
8. **Day 8:** Entered grid mode 🌐 — managed buses in Pandas DataFrame to compute fault currents and export results.
